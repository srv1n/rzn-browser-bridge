# Rzn:Browser Bridge - Native Browser Control System

üëã Welcome to Rzn:Browser Bridge! This system demonstrates an architecture for browser automation using a Chrome extension that communicates with local Rust applications. By leveraging Chrome's Native Messaging and inter-process communication, we've created a flexible and maintainable solution for browser control tasks.

## Overview

This project connects three main components:

1. **Chrome Extension**: Runs in the browser and initiates actions
2. **Broker (`rzn_broker`)**: Handles Native Messaging with Chrome and relays messages
3. **Main Application (`example_app`)**: Processes requests and implements core functionality

Together, these components provide a foundation for browser automation, web scraping, or any task that requires communication between a browser extension and local applications.

## Why This Architecture?

You might wonder why we've chosen a three-part architecture instead of a simpler design. Here's our rationale:

### The Broker Advantage

* **Separation of Concerns**: The broker focuses solely on communication protocol handling, while the main app focuses on business logic
* **Process Independence**: The main application can be developed, run, and restarted separately from the browser connection
* **Fault Tolerance**: If the main app crashes, the broker can potentially restart it or handle errors gracefully
* **Protocol Isolation**: The main app doesn't need to implement the Native Messaging protocol

### Technical Foundation

* **Native Messaging**: Chrome's standard for extension-to-native-app communication
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Efficient local socket/pipe communication between the broker and main app
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Both Rust applications use Tokio for responsive, non-blocking I/O handling

## How It Works

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of a simple "ping" request:

1. **Extension**: Initiates a request (e.g., `sendSimplePing()` in the console)
2. **Extension ‚Üí Chrome**: Sends a JSON message through Native Messaging
3. **Chrome ‚Üí Broker**: Chrome launches the broker if needed and writes the message to its stdin
4. **Broker**: Reads the message and forwards it through the IPC socket
5. **Main App**: Receives the message, processes it, and generates a response
6. **Main App ‚Üí Broker**: Sends the response back through the IPC socket
7. **Broker ‚Üí Chrome**: Writes the response to stdout
8. **Chrome ‚Üí Extension**: Delivers the response to the extension's message listener
9. **Extension**: Processes and displays the response

The message flow looks like this:

```
+-------------------+      stdin/stdout      +-----------------+      IPC Socket      +-------------------+
| Chrome Extension  | <--------------------> |  rzn_broker     | <----------------> |  example_app      |
+-------------------+  (Native Messaging)    +-----------------+  (interprocess)    +-------------------+
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* **Rust & Cargo**: [Install the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* **Google Chrome**: Or any Chromium-based browser supporting Native Messaging

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **‚ùó IMPORTANT: Update Extension ID ‚ùó**
   * Load the extension in Chrome's developer mode (see step 4)
   * Find your extension's ID in `chrome://extensions`
   * Open `com.yourcompany.projectagentis.broker.json`
   * Replace `"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EXTENSION_ID"` with your actual extension ID in the `allowed_origins` field

3. **Run the Setup Script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This script:
   * Builds the Rust applications in release mode
   * Determines the correct Native Messaging Host directory for your OS
   * Creates and installs the manifest file with the correct path to the broker executable

4. **Load the Extension**
   * Go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
   * Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right)
   * Click "Load unpacked"
   * Select the `extension` directory from this project
   * Ensure the extension is enabled

## Trying It Out

1. **Start the Example App**
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/example_app
   ```
   You should see a message indicating it's listening for connections

2. **Test the Connection**
   * Go to `chrome://extensions`
   * Find the "Rzn:Browser Bridge" extension
   * Click the link to inspect views/background page
   * In the console, type `sendSimplePing()` and press Enter

3. **Observe the Results**
   * **Extension Console**: Should show the sent ping and received pong
   * **Example App Terminal**: Should show logs about receiving the ping and sending the response

## Design Considerations

* **Message Format**: JSON provides human-readability and cross-language compatibility
* **Message Framing**: Each message is prefixed with a 4-byte length to ensure proper message boundaries
* **Error Handling**: Basic logging with potential for more sophisticated error recovery
* **Cross-Platform**: The `interprocess` crate handles platform-specific IPC mechanisms
* **Security**: Native Messaging provides extension isolation, with Chrome managing permissions

### Known Limitations

* Message structs are currently duplicated in both Rust applications
* Error handling is minimal (primarily logging)
* The broker does not currently attempt to launch the main app if it's not running

## Future Enhancements

* **Shared Types Library**: Move message definitions to a dedicated crate
* **Real Browser Automation**: Implement actual control logic using `headless_chrome` or Playwright
* **Robust Error Handling**: Add retry logic and better error reporting
* **Task Queue**: Support multiple concurrent automation tasks
* **Auto-Launch**: Allow the broker to start the main app if needed
* **Configuration**: Make socket names and paths configurable
* **Packaging**: Create installer scripts for easier distribution
* **Security Enhancements**: Add message validation and permission controls
